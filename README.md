# NamePad: A Web Application for Managing Favourite First Names

## Overview
**NamePad** is a web application designed to help users search for, filter, and manage a list of favourite first names. The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface for browsing a comprehensive database of names, which can be filtered by various criteria. Users can save their favourite names to a personal notepad for prioritization or further management.

The application is powered by **Node.js** and **Express** on the server side and uses a modern browser-based client-side application. Persistent data storage is handled by **MongoDB**. Additionally, advanced build tools like **esbuild** and **Less** are used to ensure a streamlined development process.
